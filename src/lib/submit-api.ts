/**
 * Pushing the queue to OneAdvanced — the four endpoints that between them log in as the user and
 * post every unposted row.
 *
 * <p>Both routes are two calls, and both are stateful on the server: `prepare` builds a driver and
 * parks it in the per-user `UserStateStore`, and the second call finds it there. So the two calls
 * must reach the same backend process, and a `prepare` whose second call never comes just leaves a
 * driver to be replaced by the next one.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   azure  POST /azure-id/prepare {creds} → push sent, maybe a number to match
 *          GET  /azure-id/complete        → blocks until the user taps Approve, then posts
 *
 *   otj    POST /prepare-browser  {creds} → stops at the TOTP field
 *          POST /submit-with-mfa  {code}  → finishes the login, then posts
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Submitting is the last step of <i>both</i> second calls — there is no separate "now post"
 * endpoint. A login that succeeds and posts nothing is `nothing_to_post`, not a failure.
 *
 * <p>Both prepare calls send the credentials sealed by `credential-seal.ts`; the hosted backend
 * accepts nothing else. A self-hosted one gets them plain: its TLS ends at the owner's own
 * `tailscale serve`, and it cannot hold the key this build pins.
 *
 * <p>All four are live on `staging`. The step-05 work that reinstated the two prepare endpoints as
 * POSTs taking credentials in the body — rather than reading a copy stored server-side — landed as
 * otjServices #33, and the learner ID endpoints these run against landed as #32. The shapes below
 * are the ones that shipped, read off `OneAdvancedCredentials`, `PrepareResponse` and
 * `SubmitWithMfaRequest`, not the ones `steps-04-08-implementation-plan.md` §05.1–05.2 proposed:
 * the plan named the credential fields `oneAdvancedUsername` / `oneAdvancedPassword` and the
 * implementation did not. Sending those names is not a type error and not a 404 — it deserialises
 * to two nulls and comes back 400 "credentials missing", which reads like a rejected password.
