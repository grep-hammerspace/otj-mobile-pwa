 * Normalisation and validation for the edit sheet — `PUT /otj-services/pending/{id}`.

 * <p>React-free and side-effect-free so the rules can be read, tested and changed without going
 * near the modal that renders them. The split matters because these rules are a *mirror*: the
 * server enforces the same set, and it does not trust a byte of what happens here. All of this
 * exists so a mistyped date shows an error under the field instead of after a round trip.
 *
 * <p>Every rule traces to something that already existed before this screen did — the JSON schema
 * the model is constrained to (`ParsedActivities.Entry`), the working-hours rule in
 * `llm_prompt.txt`, or the payload `OtjDriver` builds for OneAdvanced. Nothing here is a new
 * policy, deliberately: an edited row must not be able to end up less valid than a parsed one, and
 * a rule the edit screen enforced alone would be a rule the main logging path silently allowed.
